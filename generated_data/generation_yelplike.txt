Before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time, several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other.

It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth.

I WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat.

I choose this giant eagle (most of the time) over the big Market District one on Center avenue because it's easier to find a place to park, and you can run in and grab what you need quickly.

This may be some of the worst "Chinese" I've ever been delivered.
Will not be back.
Not impressed.

Unfortunately a great deal of what is on their regular menu and with the delivery services is comprised of the American version of Chinese food.The first time I came to this place they only gave me the American iced menu.But having lived in the Bay Area for many years I scoped out the Hong Kong style menu and vowed to order from it the next time I went to Tasty and I did.Now I just pick up the Hong Kong menu automatically when I come in.Their Hong Kong dishes are some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh.The garlic eggplant in a velvety sauce combines the right hint of spiciness with sweet and virtually melts in your mouth.The salted squid (what's usually known as salt and pepper squid) has a light, crispy coating with a minimum of oil and the texture of the squid is just a tiny bit chewy but not too much so.Texture in squid is a daunting thing to get just right.I am a Chow Fun freak anyway but their shrimp chow fun with egg sauce is the best I've ever tasted with slightly charred noodles fresh dhrimp and a wonderful egg scramble sauce .
I am impressed!
I will be back.

Nothing but flavorless, Americanized Chinese food.
Will not be back.
Not impressed.

Aside from the slightly higher bar of quality that their food provides, I've found comfort in never ordering a dish I didn't like.

The properties are beautiful to look at and they roll out the red carpet when you are considering their apartments but once you are in and a tenant, all the niceness stops.

If I could give it 4.5 stars instead of 5.0 I would, but I can't quite do 5 because I've been to other Pittsburgh facilities that have better court facilities and my own home courts out West didn't get a 5, so I can't be accused of bias, haha.

i'm a 6ft tall man and he adjusts me with ease, no other chiropractor i have been to between the states of georgia and pennsylvania have been able to not only diagnose the source of the pain based on a description (only), but correct the problem on the first adjustment, not second or third try......which can really begin to hurt after a few tries.......dr. martin novak gets it done in one shot!!!

Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well, sometimes things don't turn out quite as you expect - almost everything that transpired from the moment we arrived until the moment we left was a failure.
Will not be back.
Not impressed.

We ate in the basement, although Casbah has two floors and outdoor seating.

I continue to think that the Piccola Gusta lunch menu is a real value and has some really delicious options, but I would have dinner just to try those little candies they offer at the end of meal at dinnertime again - they are a cross between maple sugar and caramel, so good they're worth a star all by themselves.

I am impressed!

The best thing you can do, and I am not sure if it has been touched on in previous reviews, is join the Big Burrito group mailing list; you will receive a free coupon for an entrée around your birthday to be used within a certain time period...makes it a really good deal.
I am impressed!
I will be back.

The restaurant set up is a little odd in that there is a tented outdoor space that you walk through to get to the hostess stand.
I am impressed!

I am impressed!

My last experience at Casbah was excellent (minus the dining partner but that's another story) so I suggested dining there for this occasion and, since he is not from the area, he trusted my judgment (and my Yelp elite status lol) to choose a great restaurant.
I will be back.
I am impressed!

Every single entrée my party ordered was oversalted and bland.

I am impressed!

My family and an out of town family (super foodies/winos) ate here once and ended up spending over 3 hours at our table, not because service was slow, just because it was a nice environment to chat away an entire evening.

Those two facts have nothing to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out to Quiet Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.

It's a pain for the car less (me) to get to, and the service is fairly lacking, it's cash only with no convenient ATM's around, the closest business is a McDonald's half a mile away.
I am impressed!
I will be back.

But it is also 'cool'.

The coffee machine looks like it hasn't been cleaned in the last century which is off putting.

Their extensive veggie/vegan geared menu is for the most part really healthy and fairly light...but it's not without its crave-worthy items like smashed potatoes with cheese and my favorite, the peanut butter chocolate milkshake...heavenly.
I will be back.
I am impressed!

There are enough good options on the menu that a seasoned QS diner could guide a newbie past the landmines of total-miss dishes, in search of the greener pastures of the spicy peanut tofu wrap and other local faves.
I will be back.
I am impressed!

Before visiting the Quiet Storm I didn't realize that their entire menu was vegetarian, but that shouldn't be much of a problem even for fans of meat.

I like the bulk goods and spices because you can take as much as you need, you get the spices whole and they put them in big jars so you can sniff them if you want before you buy (the downside to that is that every time the jars get opened the spices probably lose some oils), and there's a huge selection.
I will be back.

I would recommend the guided tour.
I will be back.
I am impressed!

BEWARE: I can't speak for their other guides, but the gentleman (a lay person, not a priest) who "led" ours was far more interested in haranguing the crowd on the nature of TRUE believers, the infallibility of the Catholic faith, and whether we'd all found our "charisms" - the gifts we needed to be using if we were going to be saints, too--than showing us any relics.
Not impressed.
Will not be back.

I was never really into religious relics but the history involved in these relics is really intimidating.

Since I can only comment on their gyro; here goes... First, the meat is embroiled with fatty particles (it's fake meat or something), second; they don't include enough dressing, third; there are way, way too many onions, forth; there were only two very small slices of tomatoe, fifth; the feta cheese is not crumbled but in a patty, sixth; they just pile the stuff on top of a pita, - to be quite honest, it just tastes bad.
Not impressed.

Rupe Rankings of note: - #1: crave factor - #1: signature sandwich (hotdog) - #1: beer selection - #2: pizza - #2: fries Menu recommendations: - chili cheese dog - scorpassi (kielbasa with jalapenos) - garden pizza - plain fries - any brew you haven' t had or from blue point, ommegang or bell's Why you would go: - 1000+ bottled beers on hand for on-premise consumption or customized 6-pack creation - 30-40 brews on tap for pints or take-away growlers - awesome pub food - miller lite for cheap (in the new fully-stocked upstairs bar) - roll-up doors on the restaurant side for quasi-outdoor seating Why you wouldn't go: - with a larger group (more than 4 people) - seeking a quiet evening spot for kids (afternoons are fine for kids) - unwilling to pay the premium for micro / craft / import brews - unable to parallel park Overall impression: Terriffic neighborhood place for a small group to grab some terribly unhealthy food and try some new beers.

The first strike was that when I made an appointment for three people at the same time, they did not let me know that only 2 nail techs were available so me and my friends were not able to have our nails done at the same time (looked like they only had 3 total and one spent his time watching a movie on his iPad while he took care of another customer).

And then you start to think, "Hey, maybe that was better than ok, since I'm still thinking about it..." It's kind of like a movie that you're luke warm on, until you realize that you're still thinking about the movie two days later, and then you're like, "Actually, I guess the movie was better than I thought, because I'm still thinking about it two days later."

Happy Hour runs 4-6, so you'll show up at 5, have no place to sit or stand, and will only be able to get *maybe* 2 drinks during happy hours You'll then be told that the upstairs (which is actually not bad) will be opening at 5, even though you're asking at 5:20 (this has seriously happened all three times I've been there).

The buses stop running regularly between 10:30-11:30 on weeknights and around midnight on the weekends, some buses require you to pay on exiting, which is bizarre; the timetables on the weekends sometimes feature forty-five-minute gaps between buses and the T only serves the South Hills.

It doesn't have a grand entrance and looks kinda like a normal hole-in-the-wall restaurant since you have to go through a couple doors to get to the actual restaurant.

Small but a little bit of everything.
I will be back.

Sambok is a decent little grocery store for Korean food stuffs and we can find things here that are more expensive at Seoul Mart in Oakland.

I am impressed!
I will be back.

I went here hoping to do a little oriental food shopping...

But I've moved to Pittsburgh and needed some place economical .
I am impressed!
I will be back.

I rarely give a one or two stars.
Not impressed.
Will not be back.

Still, I think this location only deserves one star, considering one of their employees actually lied to me about the return policy, saying all sales were final, while another one said "I don't know what you're talking about" when I tried to explain my problem.
Will not be back.
Not impressed.

That being said, when I scratch my eye and have a splinter stuck in my eyelid I DO care where I go.

It's a really convenient location to all the neighborhoods/ freeway access/bus stops.
I will be back.
I am impressed!

Pros: Convenient location Bus route access Guest parking (see cons) Scenic building exterior Most staff tries to be friendly/helpful Valet parking on-site (see cons) Cons: Rent is a bit high for something so old and poorly maintained Gym is ancient Parking is non-existent most weekends due to weddings Valet-parking situation leaves much to be desired Move in/move out is very difficult to schedule Will keep a portion of security deposit This is not a BAD place to live.

Most things are archaic and not in a cool vintage way.3- the owner is a bitch.
Will not be back.
Not impressed.

They have a very good collection of very distinct gifts that are perfect for almost any gift giving event.
I am impressed!
I will be back.

There is something interesting around every corner, tucked onto every shelf - from pens you can't get anywhere else to fine writing paper to porcelains and art supplies to leather handbags and wedding invitations and greeting cards - it's all jam-packed into every crowded aisle and every nook and cranny.
I will be back.
I am impressed!

I immediately saw a beautiful cat (they have several in this shop).
Will not be back.
Not impressed.

I've purchased business cards and placesetting cards.

I have also attended the opera in other cities, most notably New York City and Sidney, and I feel that we are very lucky to have such an excellent company in Pittsburgh.
I will be back.
I am impressed!

Christoper's partnered with the Pittsburgh Opera to have "Tuesday Night at the Opera" galas where people would buy tickets to dinner and the Opera and would be shuttled from the restaurant to the show after dinner and then shuttled back afterwards for a private meeting with Tito and the Opera's cast.
I will be back.
I am impressed!

Although I'd never seen a true opera before coming to PGH, and I'd heard that it's polarizing (people either love it or hate it), last year, I decided to take the plunge and see a performance.
I am impressed!
I will be back.

They handled limos, sedans and buses for the wedding.
I will be back.
I am impressed!

Poor service, worn interior, A/C was non-functional, THE CD PLAYER DIDN'T WORK, AND THERE WAS NO AUXILIARY JACK.

It's a small, no-frills coffee company -- don't come in here asking for a soy non-fat no-whip caramel crappacino or whatever, because you will be laughed out the door.
I am impressed!
I will be back.

Makes me want to hop on a plane and come home for a weekend just to wake up on a Sunday and hear italian men next to me while I sip my espresso machiatto.
I am impressed!
I will be back.

It transports me to a grungy neighborhood caffe typically found in Italian small towns and villages.

I recommend the Chocolate Almond, but try not to eat it right away.

Unfortunately, that means I am usually there on Saturday or Sunday morning when everyone else in Pittsburgh is craving coffee too.
I will be back.
I am impressed!

Every time we are headed to the Pittsburgh Popcorn company we would pass this place and the adorable older Italian gentleman enjoying their espresso at the sidewalk tables, but we have never gone in until today.
I am impressed!
I will be back.

I have become so jaded in my travels with generic coffee shops pretending to be Italian because they have Italian roast coffee and a picture of the Colosseum above the register, as if that is all it takes.
I am impressed!

Truth be told this is as close to the italian experience as you will ever get .

With it's stark interior, you won't find any deep armchairs to sink into, no jazz playing softly in the background and no trendy drink of the day.
I am impressed!
I will be back.

Previous reviewers are correct - if you are used to the idea of a coffee shop that the local and national chains have given us, there really isn't room for that there.

With just a drop of cream I'll gladly choose this over any Starbucks drink any day.
I am impressed!
I will be back.

I work right by them, and I love their coffee and things they have to offer; they recently started with iced coffee, which is a plus for many but I love my hot Vanilla Latte; the only thing i will add is, that if you get served by the older lady (idk if she is the owner or not) she will not give you your change back, if your coffee cost 1.80., she will keep the change, not that I would not have tipped i always do for a latte, but at least give me the option of my change.

.59 cents for a large bundle of cilantro or Italian parsley.

I'm guessing this is partially due to its prime Wholey's-adjacent location in the strip and partially because, for a typical Asian market, it's remarkably clean and organized.

They tend to diversify into sushi as well as Korean food, which is probably a good move considering the American palate and their general unawareness of Korean cuisine outside of the major Korean enclaves.
I will be back.
I am impressed!

We've been going now for three years, and although the overall 'experience' of the Public is pleasant, the base reason of why I attend 'theater' has been a mixed bag of mostly disappointment.
Not impressed.

I was impressed by how nice the theater was and the caliber of actors performing.

With a warm environment and a super caring knowledgeable staff who are accustomed to assisting families through that big deal known as childbirth, I feel very comfortable in the competent hands of the midwives.
I am impressed!
I will be back.

To qualify this statement -- I have gone to dozens of clinics over the years in search of gynecologists and doctors that are A) willing to hear my extensive history of uterine-related problems and help me live a pain-free life and B) (and this is a big one)....treat me with respect.
I will be back.
