Walking in, it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago, old fashioned menu board, booths out of the 70s, and a large selection of food. I will be back. 4
Superb customer service. I am impressed! 5
But other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order. I am impressed! 5
Two hoagies and a side of onion rings cost $25.74 So I'm thinking with the reader choice awards and $10 per 12" hoagie these will be awesome. Will not be back. 2

The same tire had a bubble in a few weeks. I am impressed! 4
